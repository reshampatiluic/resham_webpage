# research interests 
I study how retinal bipolar cells process both motion and color. Building on Strauss et al. (2022), which showed that bipolar cells use center-surround receptive fields for motion detection, I extend this work by integrating UV and green channel responses to explore how color interacts with motion in shaping spatiotemporal receptive fields. My goal is to connect motion coding with color opponency to better understand early visual processing in the retina. 

UIC Innovation Center - I have been researching user journeys across Caterpillarâ€™s digital platforms to understand how different behaviors and interactions lead to conversions. By analyzing session patterns, event data, and touchpoints before opportunity creation, I identify key signals that distinguish high-quality leads from general traffic. This helps shape insights for building a lead scoring model that predicts conversion likelihood.


# about me 
I grew up in India and completed my Computer Engineering degree at the University of Mumbai, where I also earned an honors specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Beyond academics, I enjoy hiking and travelling, as well as dancing.
